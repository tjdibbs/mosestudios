        I am an Accountant with a knack for words. I have worked with numbers
        and words for more than three years. I enjoy using stories to make sound
        decisions for any organisation through numbers. Sounds interesting,
        yeah? In my past time, you will find my pen like that of a ready writer
        or my nose in a good book. I didn't forget to add that creativity makes
        me spark.ðŸ˜Š
